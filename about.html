    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Andres, I'm 19 years old and I am currently studying software enginieering at Cenfotec</p>
    <h2>Why software enginieering?</h2>
    <p>I got into this career because my first option wasn't currently available due to the consecuences of the pandemic, therefore in March of 2022 my mother suggested the program I'm currently taking and ever since I've enjoyed the career choice as it presents a different intelectual challenge.</p>
